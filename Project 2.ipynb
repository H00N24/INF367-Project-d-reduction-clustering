    "# INF367 - Project 2\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deadline: Sunday, 17.11.19, 23.59\n",
    "- Submission details: Jupyter-notebook\n",
    "- Deliver here [MittUIB.no/assignments](MittUIB.no/assignments)\n",
    "\n",
    "Projects are a compulsory part of the course. This project contributes 20% to the final grade. The grade will be based good choice of methods, correctness of answers, clarity of code and thoroughness and clarity of reporting. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Deliverables:* A jupyter notebook containing all the code to reproduce your work and a report of all your methodological choices and results. Please \"restart and run all\" before submission, so that you submit a clean version. \n",
    "\n",
    "Code should be documented and special tricks (e.g. to avoid division by zero, to make sure it takes finite time to run, etc.) should be reported. The rational behind all steps in the code should be clear from the report. In particular, if you use subsampling, you should report it, and you should consider for each step how much subsampling is appropriate. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This project is a learning experience. If we see that you have copied your answers from online resources, you will get 0 points. \n",
    "This is an application project, that means you may use any freely available library for the application tasks of the project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Model selection is an important part of the task and will be graded accordingly. Before applying machine learning algorithms, you should always consider (and report) what results you expect. When you have successfully applied machine learning algorithms, you should always comment on how well the results match your expectations. "
